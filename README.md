# osMiniProject
A simple, interactive C program that simulates CPU scheduling: FCFS, SJF (preemptive &amp; non-preemptive), Round Robin, and non-preemptive Priority. You enter processes (arrival, burst, priority), pick an algorithm, and get completion, turnaround, and waiting times plus average metrics — great for learning and demos.
